## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

The Soluify Bot harnesses the power of the [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) library to interact with the Telegram API. Once you set up the bot with your Telegram API credentials, you can list all your chats and pinpoint those you want to forward messages from. If you don't have your API credentials yet, you can grab them from your [Telegram account](https://my.telegram.org/apps).

1. **Authentication:** Securely provide your Telegram API ID, API hash, and phone number.
2. **Chat Selection:** List and select the chats you want to monitor for forwarding messages.
3. **Configuration:** Specify keywords, add signatures, set up blacklists, and more.
4. **Monitoring:** The bot continuously monitors selected chats and forwards messages based on your settings.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Error: `SessionPasswordNeededError`**
   - **Solution:** This error occurs if your Telegram account has two-step verification enabled. The bot will prompt you to enter your password after you input the verification code.

2. **Error: `FloodWaitError`**
   - **Solution:** Telegram has rate limits to prevent spam. If you encounter this error, the bot will automatically wait for the required time before retrying.

3. **Invalid API Credentials**
   - **Solution:** Double-check your API ID and API Hash. Make sure they are correctly entered and that they match the credentials from your [Telegram account](https://my.telegram.org/apps).

4. **No Messages Being Forwarded**
   - **Solution:** Ensure that the source chat IDs and destination channel IDs are correctly configured. Also, check if the keywords and blacklist settings are correct.

5. **Script Crashes or Unexpected Behavior**
   - **Solution:** Check the `soluify.log` file for detailed error messages. This can help identify the root cause of the problem.
